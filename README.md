<h2 style="display: inline-block">My Portfolio 💼 </h2>
[PORTFOLIO](https://skeiilatt.github.io/Portfolio/)
To make my portfolio I made use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in this I show the different projects I have done so far.

<h2 style="display: inline-block">My Projects 📁	</h2>
1. [New Dashboards](https://skeiilatt.github.io/News-Dashboards/) 
Project about a news search engine using a NewsAPI.org API. In this project we made use of **HTML, CSS** to make the design and architecture of the web page and **JavaScript** to perform the functionalities of the multiple actions of the page. The main objective of this project was to put into practice the API consumption.

2. [Unit Converter](https://skeiilatt.github.io/Unit_Converter/)
The Unit Converter project is an interactive web application that allows you to convert values between different units of measurement in categories such as length, temperature, weight, time, speed, volume, area and energy. It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to provide a fluid and responsive user experience. The main goal of this project was to apply web development skills to create a practical and functional tool that facilitates unit conversions quickly and accurately.

3. Dashboard_Business (Python Script)
Dashboard Business is a **Python** script designed to perform automatic actions in a data company. Three key components were used in this project: **MySQL**, as a database to store and manage the information; **Pandas**, for the efficient manipulation and analysis of the extracted data; and **Matplotlib**, for the graphical visualization of the results and finally **tkinter** for the graphical interface of the script. The main objective was to automate repetitive processes such as report generation and facilitate decision making through clear graphics and structured data.
