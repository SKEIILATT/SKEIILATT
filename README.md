## My Projects 📁

1. [News Dashboards](https://skeiilatt.github.io/News-Dashboards/)  
A project featuring a news search engine using the NewsAPI.org API. In this project, I used **HTML** and **CSS** for the layout and structure of the web page, and **JavaScript** to implement the functionalities. The main goal was to practice API consumption and data handling in a dynamic interface.

2. [Unit Converter](https://skeiilatt.github.io/Unit_Converter/)  
The Unit Converter project is an interactive web application that allows conversion between various units such as length, temperature, weight, time, speed, volume, area, and energy. It uses **HTML, CSS**, and **JavaScript** to provide a smooth and responsive experience. The goal was to develop a practical tool that reinforces essential web development concepts.

3. **Dashboard_Business (Python Script)**  
Dashboard Business is a **Python** script designed to automate repetitive tasks in a data-focused environment. It integrates:
- **MySQL**, to store and manage structured information,
- **Pandas**, for efficient data manipulation and analysis,
- **Matplotlib**, for visualizing the results through clear graphs,
- and **Tkinter**, to build a user-friendly graphical interface.

The main objective was to automate reporting and support business decision-making through structured data visualization.
